# Next UK Bank Holiday

 Just a simple React app that tells you when the next bank holiday is in the England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. I partly recreated the actual [Bank Holidays page](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays) on the government website. The data comes from the [GOV API](https://www.api.gov.uk/gds/bank-holidays/#bank-holidays).
