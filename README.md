# UK Bank Holidays

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e7bc56d2-64e7-4042-8f6b-09b1efcc40a2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/next-bank-hol/deploys)

Just a simple React app that displays lists of upcoming bank holidays in England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. This is based on the [GOV.UK Bank Holidays page](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays). The data comes from a simple JSON file provided by [GOV API](https://www.api.gov.uk/gds/bank-holidays/#bank-holidays).

The project name is based on the original intention, which was just to display the next bank holiday for each country ONLY. Then I decided to build on that and now here we are... 🤷🏾‍♂️
